1. What I could find about other BBS other than The Wells is BITNET: an US university network founded in 1981 by Ira Fuchs and Greydon Freeman. This BBS hosted a MUD (multi-user dungeon) in 1984. It ended in 2007, but had a follow-up called BITNET II. 
Another one is The Diamond Mine where you can exchange messages, play online games and download shared files. I believe you can access through the site (http://www.dmine.com/, and automatically creates a Telnet (a protocol that let you use a computer without graphics) user. Fidonet is a computer messaging and file transfer network. It was created by Tom Jennings in 1984. There are different Zones that brokes down into regions depending on the IP. You can actually join Fidonet by following a series of steps that are in the website (https://www.fidonet.org/index.html)
There is a BBS based in Taiwan called PTT and has over 1.5 million users registered. It was created by Yi-Chin Tu, a student at the National Taiwan University, in 1995 and it is currently active. 
ISCABBS is the world's largest free telnet bulletin board system on the Internet, with over 5,000 active members. It was created in 1989 by the University of Iowa. You can still download and login through the website (http://www.iscabbs.com/).
