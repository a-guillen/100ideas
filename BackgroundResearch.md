1. Holography is a "lenless photography". It is the process of creting an image without the use of a lense. Its main focus is in the use of light. The "photo is called a hologram. Those can be true three-dimensional images. This is evidenced by the fact that you can move your head while viewing the image displayed. 
A holographic image can be seen by looking into an illuminated holographic print or by shining a laser through a hologram and projecting the image onto a screen. 
There are different types of holograms, which were used for especific matters: laser recorded, holographic portraits, rainbow hologram, achromatic hologram.
