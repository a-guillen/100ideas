1. A flame war is a series of posts between two or more people were heated/insulting comments are made. I would said that are mostly made in online forums/chats. 
This has to do with emoticons because at the beginning, when they were implemented in the computer science's online bulletin board at the Carnegie Mellon University, people didn't get the idea of what ":-)" meant, so they often misinterpret it and lead to what a flame war is. 

2. An emoticon is a **representation of a human face by only using keyboard characters** like numbers, letters and punctuation marks. The word is a combination of "emotion" and "icon" (Grammarist, ?). 
An emoji is **an actual image of an emotion or idea used in text.** The emoji started in Japan, and is a combination of the word "e" which means picture, and "moji" that translates to character. (WritingExplained, ?)

3. 'Lossy' compression is a technique of when an image is reduced and compressed by discarding data with, or without, messing with the quality of it. Once you have a JPEG, you can't return it to its original form. Examples other than JPEG: GIF, MP3, MP4, OGG.
The other type of image file compression is the 'losseless' compression which restores the data that was taken from the original file. File examples are: PNG, RAW, BMP, WAV, ZIP.

4. a) Wikipedia: at the end of the article that one is reading, there is the bibliography of sources that was used to create the summary of the chosen topic. 
b) Textbook: the book itself is the data but the references, summary, title, table of content, authors, etc, are the metadata. 
c) Email: it is not the message, but the subject, title, format, subject, etc. 
d)Word/PDF document: it is a collection of software which composes the metadata in a word document, in this case its properties (size, title, pages, author, tags, etc).
d)Computer files: it is the same as the word documents.The metadata of one computer file is its properties.
